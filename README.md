## 🤖 AI Explanation Engine

### How It Works
The system uses **rule-based AI** (no external APIs or black boxes) to generate natural language insights:

1. **Trend Analysis**: Compares forecast to recent historical averages
2. **Severity Assessment**: Categorizes risk based on ILI thresholds
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Adjusts confidence based on forecast horizon
4. **Context Integration**: Combines multiple signals for comprehensive explanations

### Example Output
> "The forecast indicates moderate influenza activity in Region 5 with ILI at 3.2%. Activity is trending upward (12.3% increase), suggesting acceleration. Enhanced monitoring recommended. Healthcare facilities should prepare for increased patient volume. High confidence: Short-term forecasts benefit from recent lag patterns."

## 📈 Forecasting Methodology

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor (100 trees)
- **Features**: Lag-based time series (1, 2, 4, 8 weeks)
- **Training**: Historical data from 2015-present
- **Validation**: Out-of-sample testing with RMSE/MAE metrics

### Why Tree-Based Models?
✅ **Interpretable**: Feature importance clearly shows lag contributions  
✅ **Stable**: Robust to outliers and missing data  
✅ **Fast**: Sub-second inference time  
✅ **Reliable**: Proven performance in epidemiological forecasting  

### Forecast Confidence
- **1-2 weeks**: High confidence (85%+)
- **3 weeks**: Medium confidence (70%)
- **4+ weeks**: Moderate confidence (55%)

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Severity Thresholds
Edit `app.py`:
```python
if latest < 2:
    severity = "Low"
elif latest < 5:
    severity = "Medium"
else:
    severity = "High"
```

### Change Color Themes
Edit CSS in `templates/index.html`:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

### Add New Regions
Update `REGION_MAP` in `app.py`:
```python
REGION_MAP = {
    "Region 11": ["State1", "State2", ...],
    ...
}
```
